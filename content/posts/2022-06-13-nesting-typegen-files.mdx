Our latest [XState VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statelyai.stately-vscode) update has made it easy to enable file nesting for type gen files. But what is it?

## Explorer File Nesting

VS Code [introduced file nesting](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_67#_explorer-file-nesting) in version 1.67 back in April of 2022. This feature is elegant as it allows you to group related files in the explorer view of VS Code.

Our friend; Erik Rasmussen quickly found that this feature works well with the generated type files for XState. Thanks to Erik for his great idea!

This is how the explorer in VS Code looks without file nesting enabled when you have a machine source file alongside a generated type file for that machine.

And this is how it looks after enabling file nesting for typegen files. Now it allows you to hide the generated file behind the source if you want to.

If you’re using our VS Code extension and haven’t manually enabled file nesting for typegen files, you will see a helper prompt allowing you to enable file nesting with 1 click.

Ps. If you’re unsure what typegen is in XState, read this post where it was introduced: https://stately.ai/blog/introducing-typescript-typegen-for-xstate.
