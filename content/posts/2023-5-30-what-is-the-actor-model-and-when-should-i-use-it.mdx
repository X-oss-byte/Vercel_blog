At Stately, the [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) is one of our favorite programming paradigms, and we think it's for good reason! The actor model allows developers to build reliable message-based systems by using _actors_ to communicate. This works extremely well with state machines and statecharts, which can also be modeled as actors and can communicate much in the same ways. Read on to learn what the actor model is, the problems it seeks to solve, and how you can use it in your projects to communicate reliably across different entities.

## What is the actor model?

The actor model has been around for quite a while, dating back to the 1970's. The fact that it's still around is a bit of a testament to its utility. When researching the actor model, it's very common to see the phrase "everything is an actor", as it is a core tenant in the actor model philosophy. This simply means that in a given system, the _actor_ is the core unit of execution. Every action that occurs in the system is driven by an actor. An actor can communicate with other actors with the use of messaging, and they can also interact with external systems. Specifically, an actor can perform the following basic tasks:

- Actors can spawn other actors
- Actors can send messages to other actors
- Actors can respond to received messages
- Actors can manage their own internal state

It may sound simple, but this framework allows for the development of highly scalable and concurrent systems. There are constraints though, the most important of which is that an actor _cannot_ modify the internal state of another actor directly. This can be done implicitly with messaging (i.e an actor updating its state in response to a message) but never directly.
