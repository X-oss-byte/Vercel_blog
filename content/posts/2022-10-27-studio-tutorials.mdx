If you’re new to the Stately Studio, state machines or statecharts, we have the videos for you! Our new Stately Studio tutorials playlist on YouTube features bite-size videos to help you get started with understanding statecharts and state machines, and start modeling in the Stately Studio.

Each video explains a concept with an example machine and shows you how to use the features in the Stately Studio. You can [watch the whole playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvWgkXBB3dd4I_l-djWVU2UGPyBgKfnTQ) in one go or watch the videos individually, as shown below.
