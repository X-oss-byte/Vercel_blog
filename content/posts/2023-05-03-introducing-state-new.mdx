One of our top priorities at Stately is to ensure you can easily create and integrate state charts into your application. That’s why we’re constantly striving to remove any potential barriers.

We’re thrilled to share that generating a new chart has never been easier. Simply input [`state.new`](https://state.new) into your browser, and you can edit your brand-new chart immediately.

## What does it look like?

When you land in the editor for the first time, you’ll find an example chart to familiarize you with the concepts. You’re free to edit and delete this starting point to your liking. Notice that we have a little blue helper button in the bottom-right corner which you can click to learn more about creating state charts.

We can’t wait to see what you create!
