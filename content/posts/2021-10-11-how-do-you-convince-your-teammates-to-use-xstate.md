# How do you convince your teammates to use XState?

Last week our question of the week was “*how do you convince your teammates to use XState?*”

One of our most frequent requests for the documentation is more advice on how to convince others to use XState. Many people [read an article](XXX), [watch a talk](XXX) or [participate in a workshop](XXX) about XState and are sold on using XState themselves. But when it comes to getting their team on board, they often need more.

Thanks to all the wonderful folks who answered our question [posted to Twitter](https://twitter.com/statelyai/status/1446035499777462274) and in our #office-hours [Discord](https://discord.gg/xstate) channel, we’ve got some fantastic suggestions.

## Timing it right with a good use case for the team

> I received the task to build some pretty complicated UI components, and I opted to build them with simple state machines, implemented as good ol' `switch`-based reducers. Since we're using Redux, this approach didn't alienate my team entirely, and so the seed had been planted.
>
> Fast-forward a bit, and we're currently rewriting some of the core of our application as a state machine (or something of a Frankenstein statechart), after receiving new requirements would make it completely unmaintainable if we had continued in the same tracks. We're still doing it with `switch` (with nested states, even!), which isn't optimal, but it's way better than where we came from. 
>
>For now it does the job, but my plan is to note any pains which could easily be solved with XState, and propose a rewrite if/when the time is right. I figure it will be a much easier sell if my team is already somewhat familiar with the concepts of state machines, and we have a really good use-case on our hands.

## Make them less intimidated by the terminology
